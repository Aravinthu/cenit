* Dinamic Load validators: XML Schema, JSON Schema and EDI grammars.
* Powerful transformations tools to translate and modified several formats in others.
* Full stack HTTP RESTful API, and building client libraries for Ruby and Python.
* Social networking features to shared integration settings, named shared collections.
* Export and import shared collections as a repo on Github and a gem in Rubygems.
* Multi-tenancy with shared-schema database.
* Social networking features to share collections.

* Mongoid and Mongoff as Object Document Mapper (ODM)
* rails_admin, for build admin panel.
* RabbitMQ for internal pipeline messages.

h3. Create Cenit IO local server.

Clone the github openjaf/cenit repo and move to cenit folder.

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/openjaf/cenit
$ cd cenit
</pre>

Change branch to develop.

<pre>
$ git checkout -b develop origin/develop
</pre>

Ensure that you stay in develop branch.

<pre>
$ git branch
> *develop
</pre>

Ensure that 'develop' branch is updated.

<pre>
$ git pull origin develop
> Already up-to-date.
</pre>

Run the bundle install command to set up the required gems on your computer:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

With mongodb you don't need run migrations

Run cenit hub by port: 3000

<pre>
$ rails s -p 3000
</pre>

If you have some trouble with secret_key_base running 'rails s', you can generate a random secret key value:

<pre>
$ rake secret
</pre>	

Then take this value and put it in config/initializers/secret_token.rb:

<pre>
Cenit::Application.config.secret_key_base = 'bla' # replace this
</pre>

<pre>
go to http://localhost:3000
</pre>

If you have some trouble please check that mondodb is running.

Check that you have a working installation of "RabbitMQ":http://www.rabbitmq.com, see below the guide for install RabbitMQ.

If RabbitMQ is well installed when you run rails server then you can see:

<pre>
 [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C	
</pre>

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language
* The Rails gem
* A working installation of "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/
* A working installation of "RabbitMQ":http://www.rabbitmq.com


h3. Installing MongoDB

If you don't have MongoDB installed on your computer, you'll need to install it and set it up to be always running on your computer (run at launch).

On Mac OS X, the easiest way to install MongoDB is to install "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ and then run the following:

<pre>
brew install mongodb
</pre>

Homebrew will provide post-installation instructions to get MongoDB running. The last line of the installation output shows you the MongoDB install location (for example, */usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/1.8.0-x86_64*). You'll find the MongoDB configuration file there. After an installation using Homebrew, the default data directory will be */usr/local/var/mongodb*.

On the Debian GNU/Linux operating system, as of March 2013, the latest stable version is MongoDB 2.0.0. With MongoDB 2.0.0, the Mongoid gem must be version 3.0.x. See the "Mongoid installation instructions":http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/installation.html#installation. Change your Gemfile to use an earlier Mongoid version:

<pre>
gem 'mongoid', github: 'mongoid/mongoid'
gem 'bson_ext', '~> 1.8.6'
</pre>

h3. Installing RabbitMQ

The "RabbitMQ":http://www.rabbitmq.com site has a good "installation guide":http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html that addresses many operating systems. On Mac OS X, the fastest way to install RabbitMQ is with "Homebrew":http://brew.sh:

<pre>
brew install rabbitmq
</pre>

then run it:

<pre>
rabbitmq-server
</pre>

On Debian and Ubuntu, you can either "download the RabbitMQ .deb package":http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html and install it with "dpkg":http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkgtools.en.html or make use of the "apt repository":http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html that the RabbitMQ team provides.

For RPM-based distributions like RedHat or CentOS, the RabbitMQ team provides an "RPM package":http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html.

<pre>
Note: The RabbitMQ packages that ship with Ubuntu versions earlier than 11.10 are outdated and will not work with Bunny 0.9.0 and later versions (you will need at least RabbitMQ v2.0 for use with this guide).
</pre>
